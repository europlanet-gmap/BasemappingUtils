# Contributed scripts

Contributed pipeline scripts, instructions and individual command usage descriotion.

Contributed scripts (that will go onto documentation, too) are divided by Targed Body, and for those with several datasets, by datasets. 

Missions including several targets, such as NASA Cassini, will go for target bodies and experiments (similar processing but different target_body and CRS, so to say).

# Undigested resources and scripts / tools

Those scripts or tools have not been placed yet, but should be at least documented / linked to:

* ASAP STEREO (to automate and reproduce ASP) - https://github.com/AndrewAnnex/asap_stereo - https://asap-stereo.readthedocs.io/
* Erica's scripts for ASP - https://github.com/ericaluzzi/CTX-HiRISE-processing-DEM
