# image_processing_JRA_internal

This repo is to share, test and develop exemplary jupyter-based processign steps and pipelines for use within ISIS on GMAP cloud services, as well as locally, if needed. 
The starting point is examples of command use and command concatenation.

The idea is to use on our Juptyer HUB - or , for users that want to install as documented TBA, locally isis and asp being called via jupyter (as a first MVP interface).

This taking advantage of the library TBA name to provide command line options.

For long jobs, a queing system will be included, TBA.

For the time being there are two directories:

* [scripts](./scripts) - collecting sample scripts and makrdown commands + little explanation to be used as a starting point, input to advance the other directory
* [notebooks](./notebooks) - collecting notebooks

All files should have a self-explaining name. Markdwon individual files, also with self-explaining names, can be in the scripts directory or in the root.
